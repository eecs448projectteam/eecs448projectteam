                        regularly. We plan to build a webpage the displays a mapping of the closest rideshare car available in your 
                        area based of a set of filters you will be able to input. The goal is to allow users to see cars form all 
                        rideshare companies in the area and be able to click on the one they want which in turn would redirect 
                        them to the appropriate third party landing page for that car. We will call this software project RideFind.

                            <p>I am a junior computer engineer here at KU in the graduating class of 2024. I am available and will answer pretty much 24/7 via email: williampowers@ku.eduDiscord, GroupMe, or cell is really needed: +1 620-755-8911. I have a bit of experience in software development from recent internships and personal projects including but not limited to the following: strong knowledge of python programming especially in large class based projects, work with python’s Django framework including have built a small chat box which ran on my computers server and utilized a sqlite3 database, semi-proficient in html and CSS (enough to make our site look pretty and formatted well) but no real dynamic JavaScript webpage knowledge, a basic understanding of working in C as well as a little JavaScript but now substantial work in either language. Outside of school I enjoy building small-to-medium scale financial tech apps, usually centered around the stock market and algorithmic trading, as well as basic website creation to show my friends and my own portfolio. Non-academic hobbies include weightlifting and rock-climbing as they are both slow and steady aerobic workouts. With this project team I am hoping to branch out of my strength fields and work more with servers, databases, different frameworks, or just something new that would benefit me in future internships and even my first job.</p>

                            <p>I am a junior in Computer Science here at KU. I am graduating in 2024. I am new to software development with little experience in front-end development. However, I have good backend knowledge and I know JavaScript, C++, and HTML. I work in KU CPPR as a student IT Assistant and have a good baseline foundation in cross-systems and security. I am Accustomed to handling IT support, managing IT projects, and supporting various engineering departments with IT tools and applications. Bringing forth a motivated attitude and the ability to establish strong and productive relationships with other company members. Organized, detail-oriented, and a self-starter. Tech-savvy professional with the flexibility to work in both fast and slow-paced environments. For me, computers are intimately connected with humans hence I am supplementing my major with subjects like Anthropology, Philosophy, Psychology, and Greek studies. I believe these classes will provide me with a bird-eye view of human behavior and will enable me to make informed choices. I am looking forward to working with this team and really excited about the project. I hope this class and project supplement my front-end programming. What I am most looking forward to is creating something that has some impact on our day-to-day lives. I am hopeful that this class not just force me to make something viable but also help me create some deep, long-lasting friendships and connections.

                            <p>I am a junior majoring in Computer Science and minoring in linguistics. I plan to graduate in Fall 2025. Over the summer, I worked with the medical software company WellSky; there, I worked in an Agile development/scrum environment, and am familiar with the sprint planning cycle. I am sufficient in Python and C#, have some knowledge of the Angular framework and its related languages, and have also worked in Java and Arduino/C++ as a hobbyist. Currently, I work as an SI Leader, where I facilitate peer study sessions for students in Programming II (EECS 268). 
 
                                I am excited to further my current programming skills and learn new ones, especially from my teammates and their diverse set of experiences. I hope we create something that’s exciting for all of us.  
                                 
                                Outside of school and work, I enjoy speed-cubing and playing/listening to music. I enjoy exercising as well, especially weightlifting, archery, and dancing.  
                                 
                                I can reliably attend meetings on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday afternoons, but will try to be flexible throughout the workweek as well.

                            <p>I am a junior Computer Science Student at KU graduating in 2024. I have experience in C++, Java, JavaScript, and Python software development. I learned C++ through taking EECS 168 and 268 here at KU. I was introduced to JavaScript before coming to KU, but I got more skilled at it through taking EECS 368. I work at the KU Institute for Information Sciences as a Student IT Administrator. I am hoping to learn more about backend and frontend software development through this project. I am also hopeful that I can make some new friends through this course. I am available for team meetings on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoons, as well as on weekends. 

                                Outside of work and school, my hobbies include Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu combat and playing video games. I also enjoy tinkering with computers and technology to expand my knowledge.
